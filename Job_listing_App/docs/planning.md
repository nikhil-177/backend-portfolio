# Job Listing App (Backend)

## âœ¨ Why build this?
As a backend developer, I want to build a job listing platform to understand how real-world APIs work â€” including authentication, authorization, filtering, and data handling. This project will help me apply backend concepts in a practical, career-relevant context.

## ðŸ§© What problems does it solve?
While many job portals exist, this version will focus on:
- Simplified backend API for developers and recruiters
- Fast, filterable access to jobs
- Easy candidate management for employers
- Reducing dependency on bloated job sites

Itâ€™s also an educational exercise that demonstrates how backend systems work in a real application setting.

## ðŸ”¨ How will I build it?
This project will focus only on the backend, using:
- **Node.js + Express** for the server
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** for database
- **JWT** for secure authentication
- **RESTful APIs** for CRUD operations on jobs, users, and applications
- **Role-based access control** for admin, recruiter, and applicant
- Modular folder structure and proper documentation

The plan is to keep it scalable and ready for frontend integration later (React or any other).
